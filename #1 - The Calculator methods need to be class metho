#1 - The Calculator methods need to be class methods. So they'll be defined with self.add, self.subtract, etc. And then they are called on the class like this: Calculator.add(arg1, arg2)
Also, you don't want to puts inside of a method if possible. You want to made it pure by doing only what the method name implies. So I would just have your methods return the result of the addition, subtraction, etc. Let me know what questions you have about this.
